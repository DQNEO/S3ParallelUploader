# S3ParallelUploader

This is a Java command line tool which uploads many files in parallel into a AmazonS3 bucket.

## Motivation

My CPAN module Amazon::S3::FastUploader does'nt work on Windows.

http://search.cpan.org/~dqneo/Amazon-S3-FastUploader-0.06/

So I re-invented it in Java language.

## Requirement

This tool requires AWS SDK for Java.

see http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava
